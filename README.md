## Introduction
1. The variable 'season', 'mnth', 'yr', 'weathersit', and 'workingday' have a significant impact on the bike demand.
2. The bike demand is high during the Fall season and in the months of January, July, September, November, and December.
3. The demand for bikes increases every year, and there is no significant difference in demand between working days and holidays.
4. The bike demand is almost constant throughout the week.


## General Information

- What is the background of your project?
Understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after the Covid-19 quarantine situation ends.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e., which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
Know the accuracy of the model i.e., how well those variables describe the bike demands.


## Technologies Used
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels

## Recommendations

The company should focus on increasing bike availability during the high-demand season (Fall) and months (Jan, Jul, Sep, Nov, Dec).
Keep track of weather conditions and adjust bike availability accordingly.

## Conclusions
On analyzing data, it was observed that the linear regression model was able to predict bike demand precisely.
